# Breast-cancer-predicton-and-EDA
Hey everyone,
This is my first ML project based on the information of Clinical Records of Heart Patients . Created three models(KNN ,SVM, Decision tree algorithms) that can predict, whether the individual has breast cancer or not

PROJECT 1 : CLINICAL DETAILS OF Breast cancer patients

Machine Learning project Consisting of the Clinical details of Breast cancer patients which comes under the class Supervised machine learning datasets. It is then used for classification problems using 3 different Algorithms K Nearest Neighbours,Decision Tree,Support Vector Machine 

Machine Learning means the use and development of computer systems that are able to learn and adapt without following explicit instructions, by using algorithms and statistical models to analyse and draw inferences from patterns in data.

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning that uses labeled data to train machine learning models. In labeled data, the output is already known.

STEPS IMPLEMENTED IN THE PROJECT :-

1. Data preprocessing
2. Seperate X and Y variables
3. Spliting the data set into Training & Testing data
4. Normalising the data using
StandardScaler
5. Creating Knn Model Using KNeighborsClassifier,Decision tree,Svm model using SVC classifier
6. Perfomance Evaluation :
Accuracy Score, Classification Report
